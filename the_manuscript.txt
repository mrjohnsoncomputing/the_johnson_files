Barbara VanDenburgh from USA TODAY is browsing the shelves this week for some of the hottest new books on the market, and sharing her thoughts on it with you. Author Thomas Harris is back with a new novel about a meat merchant who kidnaps young women and harvests vital organs from them for sale to a wealthy international clientele.  The help for Johnson puts Kardashian West in the spotlight for her work on prison reform, and "Life" promises a change behind the scenes. It's Harris's first book in 13 years, so you can rejoice at the prospect of creating a brand new psychopath for Hannibal Lecter. The Kirkus Reviews star gushed: 'I laughed out loud and consistently every cover of the story, from the first page to the last, and I still laugh. In McCarthy, doctors and researchers give readers an insight into the battle for a cure for antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as superbugs. Kirkus Reviews said: "The author's narrative style is powerful and empathetic in a compelling combination that leaves the reader informed and optimistic. I hope that this will encourage you to continue reading and writing safely until you collapse, but I hope that it will encourage those of you who continue reading and writing after the break. Sam Redd Sam Redd read and read all night, his mind full of facts, information and pictures from far-off places. One night he decided it was time for him to write his own book, and his imagination staggered with wonder and imagination. It was at home, he was reading and writing, but one night Sam decided to be at home for the first time in his life. He decided to write a book called Lonely Cheese, and working on it made him very hungry. It was good that he found so many crumbs to eat when he finished the illustrations. Proud, proud, he posted a picture of himself amid a pile of crumbs on the floor outside his London home. I went to the library's biography and autobiography department and put my first book on the shelf. I wrote the words and a picture of Sam on the cover and called it "the squeaky muse of my life." I drew the picture by posing in a small mirror and then sketching what I saw, and then sketching it again. Then I went to the biography and autobiography department of the library and then to the art department of the New York Public Library and the museum department. When the librarian opened the nursery in the morning, a piece of paper stuck to the door. I looked down at the pencils that were ready to go and saw my own face smiling at me. The little girl said: "Who is the author next to me in the mirror? Maybe you play an instrument, maybe you are a good artist, or you could explain how to make a picture, but how do you do that? They can explain so many possibilities and how they play their instruments, so what do they do? There is a picture of a little boy in a truck looking at a large book, eyes wide open and hands in his pockets, like a child. It was called The Mouse's Villa Secret and gave Sam goosebumps as he wrote the scary scene. Later, he put the lonely cheese on his desk and showed it to the children at story time. A full moon shone through the darkened library as Sneaky put his book on the shelf and then returned to his little hole in the wall. It was a book for me, "said the librarian, just as it was for Sam," but it gives me goosebumps when I write it.

Elementary teachers in more than 10% of schools in the U.S. are using this program because the Mystery Science product turns any elementary teacher into an incredible science teacher.Mystery Science makes open-and-go lessons that inspire kids to love science. They make it possible for an elementary teacher without a background in science to teach lessons that entertain and inspire students. Teachers login to mysteryscience.com and browse lessons on all topics they are required to teach for science. Every lesson begins with an actual question that scientists wondered long ago—and eventually figured out. These are genuine questions that kids ask today such as “What do plants eat?” or “Why is there sand at the beach?”The journey begins with a video that sets up the mystery. Teachers then guide students through a discussion where the kids try to figure out the answer for themselves. A series of recorded observations gives students clues. The lesson culminates in a hands-on activity where students are conducting an experiment or building a model in order to solve the mystery for themselves.When teachers use Mystery Science, they are re-creating the process of scientific discovery in the classroom. Students are not simply memorizing conclusions, instead they’re learning how people discovered these things to be true.I had a chance to connect with Doug Peltz and Keith Schacht, the founders of Mystery Science to learn how they started their company, their impact in the classroom so far, and where they see this all going.Mystery ScienceAlexander Taub: Mystery Science is such a clever idea, starting with the questions asked long ago to learn science. How did you come up with it?Doug Peltz: Everyone has had the experience of being taught something that felt pointless. This is a fundamental failing of our education system. It’s unacceptable. At Mystery Science we hold it as a core principle: you can’t teach something that a person doesn’t care to learn. The first task of an educator is to motivate.Keith Schacht: Back in 2012, Doug was still teaching science in the classroom down in Irvine, California. I was visiting from out of town—we’ve been friends a long time—and I spent a day sitting in on his classes. I already knew Doug was a great teacher, but it was on this day of observing how he taught that I realized that all of my science classes had been taught backwards. Here I was watching Doug teach science forwards.Everyone is so focused on teaching the conclusions of scientists that they forget these conclusions are the end of a process. We all remember being told that plants need carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water; the Earth’s crust is made up of tectonic plates; and there is a periodic table of elements that includes things like carbon.But each of these scientific discoveries began as a question; someone became curious about something in the world and wanted to figure it out. What do plants eat? What created the mountains? Why do things turn black when they burn? Over a period of years, decades, or even centuries people investigated these questions, collected clues, and eventually solved the mystery. To separate scientific conclusions from an actual question that people—and kids—wonder about, turns science class into a dry vocabulary class. All too often students parrot scientific words and definitions without ever learning what these conclusions are an answer to, and how we know them to be true!Peltz: To sum it up, we start with questions because we revere the process of scientific discovery. We know it’s in early science education that scientific understanding, thinking, and curiosity are either developed in children, or lost.Taub: How have classes with Mystery Science performed compared to other science classes?Schacht: I’ll tell you the most important stat for all of us to measure and improve: it’s the number of children who grow up as problem solvers. Meaning: as they become adults, they have developed the ability to figure things out for themselves.This is both a difficult statistic to measure and it takes a decade or more to see the results. In the meantime, we need to use near-term proxies for the ultimate impact. We focus on getting real science instruction taught regularly during the years of children’s peak curiosity—the elementary grades (kindergarten through fifth grade).Peltz: What most people don’t realize is that in all this talk today about STEM education reform, nearly everyone is neglecting the formative early years. Only about 6% of elementary schools in the U.S. have a science teacher on staff. I used to work at one of the schools in this 6%.It often surprises people to learn that science is rarely taught in elementary schools in the U.S. This is because elementary teachers are being put in an impossible situation. Most of them are subject-matter generalists. They’re expected to teach and be experts on every subject. Science is the most difficult core subject for them to teach—in addition to being tested the least—so it’s the one that most often gets skipped.Yet right around the time children are entering kindergarten, when they’re five or six years old, their curiosity is exploding. They’re asking questions constantly. It’s critical that we develop habits of thinking and scientific understanding or this curiosity fades away.Schacht: The best early indicator we have of Mystery Science’s impact is how often teachers report that they’re now teaching science regularly. Often, they let us know that science has become their students’ favorite subject and students get upset if they don’t receive science that week! We have not yet quantified the increase in science teaching that Mystery Science has catalyzed, but this is the impact we are focused on.Taub: What is the goal of Mystery Science, as a company?Peltz: Our mission is to accelerate human progress. The only thing holding back human progress is the number of people who can solve problems—are able to figure things out for themselves. We are increasing this number in the next generation by fixing STEM education.There are three things that are needed to fix STEM education: (1) focusing on the years of peak curiosity, (2) beginning with questions rather than answers, (3) and teaching children how we know things to be true.Schacht: Our near-term goal is to ensure Mystery Science becomes the most popular science curriculum in the country. We’re already the fastest growing science resource, already used by teachers in 10% of elementary schools. This past year we reached more than one million children in classrooms.Taub: What’s the business model of Mystery Science? Do you charge anything to use?Schacht: Most teachers learn about Mystery Science from a friend or colleague. They can sign up on the website for free and use everything we’ve created for a full school year. At the end of the school year their school or district purchases a membership for all of the teachers to continue using Mystery Science.Core to our mission is not only to create the best science learning experiences for children, but to make them the most affordable option on the market. Every other curriculum on the market is at least twice as expensive, many are five or six times as expensive as Mystery Science. It’s appalling both how expensive traditional textbooks and science curriculum are, and how rarely they’re actually used in the classroom.Taub: Does the name Mystery Science limit to what you can do in the future with other potential courses?Peltz: We’re intentionally staying focused on science. Science is the most important subject to be fixed in schools in order to accelerate human progress, so we’ll be focused on it for quite some time. We have quite a monumental task ahead of us. We’ve basically set ourselves the task of taking the sum total of human knowledge about how the world works and translating it into a form that is understandable to children. This is the science of explaining science—and it’s a field still in its infancy.Taub: Any great stories from teachers you can share?Schacht: One of the most surprising things to arise out of our success is the volume of fan mail we get. Doug now gets fan mail from students and teachers–actual letters sent to him through the postal service, expressing their thanks for what we’re doing. We get emails expressing gratitude literally every day now; it blows us away.Peltz: I knew we were creating something special when early on with Mystery Science, a teacher told us that after he finished his first Mystery Science lesson, his students applauded!One teacher recently messaged us to say that she gave her each of her students an end-of-year survey to find out what their favorite parts of the year was. Most of them cited doing Mystery Science each week. Mind you, these were lists that included things like recess.Another child got unexpectedly picked up early from school one day and was in tears that he was going to miss Mystery Science that week.I think one of my favorite stories was a parent who sent me a photo of her child ambling through the front yard on a foggy morning. She said her child came inside with a look of profound excitement on her face and said, “Mom! Hurry! This is our chance to feel what it’s like to walk through a cloud… fog is a cloud that’s on the ground!”Her daughter explained that she’d learned this from a Mystery Science lesson, and the mother was blown away. We had created this magical moment for her child; we changed how she looked at the world around her.That is what it’s all about for us.Taub: What are your plans for the rest of the year? Anything big coming out?Schacht: We have a significant expansion planned for every grade level, kindergarten through fifth grade. In addition, there are dozens of small but important ways that we’ll make it even easier for teachers to deliver incredible science experiences for their children. These range from offline support to making it easier to gather supplies for science investigations, to answering science questions that students ask their teachers. In a normal presidential election year, analysis of the role of science in the presidential campaign might focus on the nuances of the candidates’ competing priorities for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal scientific agencies. Nanoscience versus neuroscience, say, the moon versus Mars.This is clearly not a normal election year.Former vice president Joe Biden’s plans and President Donald Trump’s records on research funding are a part of the picture, of course, and of utmost importance to many academics and higher education leaders. But many scientists believe a more fundamental issue -- respect for science in government -- is at stake in this election.Trump’s continued efforts to downplay the severity of the pandemic, seen most recently in the wake of his own COVID-19 diagnosis, his rejection of public health guidance -- including, perhaps most consequentially, his mockery and failure of role modeling when it comes to face masks -- and reported efforts by his administration to interfere in scientific decision making in the nation’s public health agencies and sideline experts have raised alarms among scientists and many others. Scientists have criticized the president for rejecting scientific and other forms of expertise, including by forcing out or muzzling government-employed scientists and by eliminating many advisory committees comprised of outside experts.Opposition to Trumps policies among scientists started early in his term when many of them joined the inaugural March for Science events held on Earth Day in 2017. Although the march was nonpartisan in nature, many participants were deeply concerned by Trumps scientific policies on science. Those concerns have grown substantially since then.The magazine Scientific American recently endorsed Biden despite never before having backed a candidate in its 175-year history.“The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the U.S. and its people -- because he rejects evidence and science,” the editors wrote in an editorial. “The most devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which cost more than 190,000 Americans their lives by the middle of September. [The figure is now more than 215,000.] He has also attacked environmental protections, medical care, and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges.”Similarly, The New England Journal of Medicine took a step unprecedented in its 208-year history of condemning one candidate and endorsing, at least by implication, another.“When it comes to the response to the largest public health crisis of our time, our current political leaders have demonstrated that they are dangerously incompetent,” the NEJM editors wrote in an editorial published last week that mentions neither Trump nor Biden by name. “We should not abet them and enable the deaths of thousands more Americans by allowing them to keep their jobs.”“The administration and the president in particular have undermined science every opportunity that they’ve had,” said Holden Thorp, the editor in chief of Science and author of a scathing Sept. 18 editorial, Trump Lied About Science, condemning Trump for intentionally misleading the American public about the severity of the pandemic in February. Trump has maintained that he downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic to prevent a public panic.Thorp noted that Trump has consistently proposed sizable cuts to science funding.“Thankfully, folks in the Congress don’t agree with him about that, and we’ve had good increases in science funding over the last few years, but that’s not something that the president deserves any credit for,” Thorp said.Thorp added that Trump’s rhetoric “has undermined everything that science has said except when he wants to use it for his purposes.”The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University and the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund jointly maintain the Silencing Science tracker, which keeps a running tally of instances of federal and state government attempts to censor or otherwise inhibit scientific processes or the use of scientific information since the 2016 election.“Whenever there is a scientific finding that runs counter to the administration’s objectives such as encouraging fossil fuel use or diminishing the dangers of the virus, they work hard to squelch it. It’s an ostrich administration,” said Michael B. Gerrard, the Andrew Sabin Professor of Professional Practice at Columbia Law School and director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.Gerrard said he would expect a “dramatic change” should Biden win the election.“For one thing, Biden embraces the science of climate change and of other environmental hazards and the virus,” Gerrard said. “It would be a 180-degree reversal, just as Trump completely reversed from Obama’s policies. Obama had serious scientists in his administration and he listened to them. I would expect we’d see that kind of thing again.”The Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but the former vice president has said he would listen to the scientists to control the coronavirus pandemic and has implored Trump to do the same.Courtney Parella, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said in a statement that Trump has worked throughout his first term to ensure cutting-edge innovations are happening in America.She said the president is fighting to put America First, encourage research and development, and reignite exploration and invention, and his Administration will continue to pave the way for science and research to flourish in the U.S.Federal Research PrioritiesTrump has repeatedly questioned scientific consensus, as when he rejected the premise last month that climate change was a contributing factor in causing the wildfires raging in the American West, insisting instead that Itll start getting cooler and saying I dont think science knows what is happening.The president has denied or downplayed the scientific evidence about the threat of climate change. His administration rolled back one of Obamas signature climate achievements, rules that would improve fuel efficiency standards for cars -- the rollback is being challenged in court -- and initiated the U.S.’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. His campaign website boasts that Trump “has approved the infrastructure and provided the resources needed to unleash oil and gas production in the U.S.”Biden, meanwhile, has pledged a move toward a 100 percent clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050, and has promised “the largest-ever investment in clean energy research and innovation.” How much of his ambitious $400 billion plan he is able to accomplish will depend on the makeup of Congress after the election, but the tone toward climate science and climate change policies would undoubtedly change markedly.In terms of other research priorities, Trumps administration has prioritized some research areas, notably artificial intelligence and quantum information science. His most recent budget request would double research and development investments in those two areas by 2022. However, his budget proposal would also have cut the overall NSF and NIH budgets by 7 percent each, among other cuts to science.“There have been some exceptions, but they’ve recommended cuts for most agencies every year, and many of those cuts would have been historically large, said Matt Hourihan, director of the research and development budget and policy program at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Hourihan said the Trump administration has targeted especially deep cuts to research related to renewable energy and energy efficiency, climate and other environmental research, manufacturing, agriculture, and basic science.Biden is calling for $300 billion over four years investment in research and development and breakthrough technologies -- from electric vehicle technology to lightweight materials to 5G and artificial intelligence.The former vice president, who oversaw the “Cancer Moonshot” initiative in Obama’s administration and lost his son Beau to brain cancer, has pledged “billions of dollars” to seek cures for cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. He has called for establishing a new agency focused on research and development in health care modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.“We’re confident and hopeful that Vice President Biden will make cancer research and medical science a national priority if he becomes president,” said Jon Retzlaff, chief policy officer for the American Association for Cancer Research. “I think it’s accurate to say that the president has not made cancer research and medical science a national priority.”We have been very concerned when we’ve seen the presidents budget proposals for NIH, but we’ve been very assured by seeing the action that Congress has taken to ignore the presidents proposals and instead double down on the importance of the NIH, Retzlaff said. Throughout Trumps term, Congress approved steady increases in NIH funding to the tune of $2 to $3 billion per year.Experts emphasize that funding for scientific research has enjoyed wide support in Congress from Democrats and Republicans.We have a lot of strong support in Congress for science and that has really saved us over the last four years, said Phil Bucksbaum, president of the American Physical Society and the Marguerite Blake Wilbur Chair in Natural Science at Stanford University. You can just imagine what would have happened if the president’s budgets had simply been passed into law.International Talent and International TensionsAnother area of concern to the scientific community involves international students and immigration policy on high-skilled workers. The Trump administration has proposed a number of policies seen by many in higher education as detrimental to international students or scholars, including a recently proposed rule that would limit the time student visa holders could stay in the U.S.The Trump administration has also suspended entry to the U.S. for holders of H-1B skilled worker visas, a temporary route by which some foreign professors come to the U.S. and that many businesses, particularly in the technology sector, rely upon.The contrast couldn’t be clearer, said Kei Koizumi, a science policy consultant and the former assistant director for federal research and development in the Obama White House. The Trump administration has used every means possible to restrict all sorts of immigration, including the high-skilled immigration and student immigration that are so vital to the health of U.S. research institutions. The Biden campaign has not been very specific, but I get the impression that at the very least they’re going to roll back the Trump administration restrictions to where they were before.Among other moves, the Biden campaign says he would exempt recent foreign graduates of American Ph.D. programs in STEM fields from any cap on employment-based visas.A related issue bound up in policies on international students and high-skilled immigration involves concerns about China and U.S. research security, an area of increasing focus across the range of federal scientific and national security and law enforcement agencies during Trump’s tenure. Experts say concerns about Chinese government efforts to exploit the relatively open environment of research universities to steal federally supported academic research are not likely to end no matter who wins the election -- though the tone may shift.“I don’t think that goes away if Biden is elected,” said Tobin Smith, vice president for policy at the Association of American Universities. “I think Democrat or Republican administration, our stance toward China is changing. It may not be quite as extreme as what we’ve seen, especially post-pandemic, with this administration trying to blame the virus on China, but the issue of China is going to be there.”Koizumi, the former assistant director for federal research and development in the Obama White House, agreed. “It is a bipartisan concern.”From my vantage point, I dont see easy answers, Koizumi said. “What gives me more hope for a Biden administration to solve this better is that [the Trump] administration has not really weighed the evidence or tried to balance competing interests. I trust a Biden administration will reach out to and bring in expert viewpoints and information from all of these sources, whether it’s universities or the national security establishment or wherever, to really think about what should be done and how the U.S. should move forward.”Coronavirus StimulusIn the short term, advocates for science say a priority is securing stimulus funding to get research back up and going again after the disruptions caused by the mass shutdowns of college labs after the start of the coronavirus pandemic last spring. Labs that continued paying graduate students and postdoctoral scholars during the shutdowns need additional funds to keep them on the payroll. Advocacy groups have pointed to other costs associated with shutting down and reopening labs, including destruction of biological samples and disposal of hazardous materials, the care of animal subjects, and the costs of restarting experiments that could not be completed.Our ultimate concern is, if they don’t get extra money, do agencies potentially have to make a decision in fiscal year 2021 about new grants versus supporting old grants -- in which case you lose yet another season of being able to start new grants, said Debbie Altenburg, assistant vice president for research advocacy and policy at the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.The coronavirus stimulus act passed by Congress and signed by Trump last spring included $1.3 billion in funding for COVID research, but it did not include funds for extensions or supplements to existing research grants.Congress and the White House are currently negotiating a second stimulus. The stimulus bill approved by the Democratic-controlled House includes funds for supporting costs associated with shutdowns of biomedical labs and extending existing National Science Foundation grants.It is unclear whether there is political will in Congress and the White House to pass a stimulus act before the election. Trump said last week that he was stopping negotiations until after the election, but he subsequently reversed himself and suggested he was interested in a large-scale deal. The White House presented House Democrats with a $1.8 trillion package, substantially larger than its previous offer but still less than the $2.2 trillion package passed by the House earlier this month.Right now, the stimulus is sort of on-again, off-again from a negotiation perspective. We’re continuing to advocate, but that’s hard to predict, said Jenny Luray, vice president of strategy and communications for Research!America, a membership and advocacy organization made up of universities, hospitals, businesses and industries, nonprofit groups, and others with a stake in research policy.Thats a really big issue and that’s one that will continue to be something that Research!America and our university members will advocate for, regardless of who wins in November.
