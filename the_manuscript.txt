Barbara VanDenburgh from USA TODAY is browsing the shelves this week for some of the hottest new books on the market, and sharing her thoughts on it with you. Author Thomas Harris is back with a new novel about a meat merchant who kidnaps young women and harvests vital organs from them for sale to a wealthy international clientele.  The help for Johnson puts Kardashian West in the spotlight for her work on prison reform, and "Life" promises a change behind the scenes. It's Harris's first book in 13 years, so you can rejoice at the prospect of creating a brand new psychopath for Hannibal Lecter. The Kirkus Reviews star gushed: 'I laughed out loud and consistently every cover of the story, from the first page to the last, and I still laugh. In McCarthy, doctors and researchers give readers an insight into the battle for a cure for antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as superbugs. Kirkus Reviews said: "The author's narrative style is powerful and empathetic in a compelling combination that leaves the reader informed and optimistic. I hope that this will encourage you to continue reading and writing safely until you collapse, but I hope that it will encourage those of you who continue reading and writing after the break. Sam Redd Sam Redd read and read all night, his mind full of facts, information and pictures from far-off places. One night he decided it was time for him to write his own book, and his imagination staggered with wonder and imagination. It was at home, he was reading and writing, but one night Sam decided to be at home for the first time in his life. He decided to write a book called Lonely Cheese, and working on it made him very hungry. It was good that he found so many crumbs to eat when he finished the illustrations. Proud, proud, he posted a picture of himself amid a pile of crumbs on the floor outside his London home. I went to the library's biography and autobiography department and put my first book on the shelf. I wrote the words and a picture of Sam on the cover and called it "the squeaky muse of my life." I drew the picture by posing in a small mirror and then sketching what I saw, and then sketching it again. Then I went to the biography and autobiography department of the library and then to the art department of the New York Public Library and the museum department. When the librarian opened the nursery in the morning, a piece of paper stuck to the door. I looked down at the pencils that were ready to go and saw my own face smiling at me. The little girl said: "Who is the author next to me in the mirror? Maybe you play an instrument, maybe you are a good artist, or you could explain how to make a picture, but how do you do that? They can explain so many possibilities and how they play their instruments, so what do they do? There is a picture of a little boy in a truck looking at a large book, eyes wide open and hands in his pockets, like a child. It was called The Mouse's Villa Secret and gave Sam goosebumps as he wrote the scary scene. Later, he put the lonely cheese on his desk and showed it to the children at story time. A full moon shone through the darkened library as Sneaky put his book on the shelf and then returned to his little hole in the wall. It was a book for me, "said the librarian, just as it was for Sam," but it gives me goosebumps when I write it.

Elementary teachers in more than 10% of schools in the U.S. are using this program because the Mystery Science product turns any elementary teacher into an incredible science teacher.Mystery Science makes open-and-go lessons that inspire kids to love science. They make it possible for an elementary teacher without a background in science to teach lessons that entertain and inspire students. Teachers login to mysteryscience.com and browse lessons on all topics they are required to teach for science. Every lesson begins with an actual question that scientists wondered long ago—and eventually figured out. These are genuine questions that kids ask today such as “What do plants eat?” or “Why is there sand at the beach?”The journey begins with a video that sets up the mystery. Teachers then guide students through a discussion where the kids try to figure out the answer for themselves. A series of recorded observations gives students clues. The lesson culminates in a hands-on activity where students are conducting an experiment or building a model in order to solve the mystery for themselves.When teachers use Mystery Science, they are re-creating the process of scientific discovery in the classroom. Students are not simply memorizing conclusions, instead they’re learning how people discovered these things to be true.I had a chance to connect with Doug Peltz and Keith Schacht, the founders of Mystery Science to learn how they started their company, their impact in the classroom so far, and where they see this all going.Mystery ScienceAlexander Taub: Mystery Science is such a clever idea, starting with the questions asked long ago to learn science. How did you come up with it?Doug Peltz: Everyone has had the experience of being taught something that felt pointless. This is a fundamental failing of our education system. It’s unacceptable. At Mystery Science we hold it as a core principle: you can’t teach something that a person doesn’t care to learn. The first task of an educator is to motivate.Keith Schacht: Back in 2012, Doug was still teaching science in the classroom down in Irvine, California. I was visiting from out of town—we’ve been friends a long time—and I spent a day sitting in on his classes. I already knew Doug was a great teacher, but it was on this day of observing how he taught that I realized that all of my science classes had been taught backwards. Here I was watching Doug teach science forwards.Everyone is so focused on teaching the conclusions of scientists that they forget these conclusions are the end of a process. We all remember being told that plants need carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water; the Earth’s crust is made up of tectonic plates; and there is a periodic table of elements that includes things like carbon.But each of these scientific discoveries began as a question; someone became curious about something in the world and wanted to figure it out. What do plants eat? What created the mountains? Why do things turn black when they burn? Over a period of years, decades, or even centuries people investigated these questions, collected clues, and eventually solved the mystery. To separate scientific conclusions from an actual question that people—and kids—wonder about, turns science class into a dry vocabulary class. All too often students parrot scientific words and definitions without ever learning what these conclusions are an answer to, and how we know them to be true!Peltz: To sum it up, we start with questions because we revere the process of scientific discovery. We know it’s in early science education that scientific understanding, thinking, and curiosity are either developed in children, or lost.Taub: How have classes with Mystery Science performed compared to other science classes?Schacht: I’ll tell you the most important stat for all of us to measure and improve: it’s the number of children who grow up as problem solvers. Meaning: as they become adults, they have developed the ability to figure things out for themselves.This is both a difficult statistic to measure and it takes a decade or more to see the results. In the meantime, we need to use near-term proxies for the ultimate impact. We focus on getting real science instruction taught regularly during the years of children’s peak curiosity—the elementary grades (kindergarten through fifth grade).Peltz: What most people don’t realize is that in all this talk today about STEM education reform, nearly everyone is neglecting the formative early years. Only about 6% of elementary schools in the U.S. have a science teacher on staff. I used to work at one of the schools in this 6%.It often surprises people to learn that science is rarely taught in elementary schools in the U.S. This is because elementary teachers are being put in an impossible situation. Most of them are subject-matter generalists. They’re expected to teach and be experts on every subject. Science is the most difficult core subject for them to teach—in addition to being tested the least—so it’s the one that most often gets skipped.Yet right around the time children are entering kindergarten, when they’re five or six years old, their curiosity is exploding. They’re asking questions constantly. It’s critical that we develop habits of thinking and scientific understanding or this curiosity fades away.Schacht: The best early indicator we have of Mystery Science’s impact is how often teachers report that they’re now teaching science regularly. Often, they let us know that science has become their students’ favorite subject and students get upset if they don’t receive science that week! We have not yet quantified the increase in science teaching that Mystery Science has catalyzed, but this is the impact we are focused on.Taub: What is the goal of Mystery Science, as a company?Peltz: Our mission is to accelerate human progress. The only thing holding back human progress is the number of people who can solve problems—are able to figure things out for themselves. We are increasing this number in the next generation by fixing STEM education.There are three things that are needed to fix STEM education: (1) focusing on the years of peak curiosity, (2) beginning with questions rather than answers, (3) and teaching children how we know things to be true.Schacht: Our near-term goal is to ensure Mystery Science becomes the most popular science curriculum in the country. We’re already the fastest growing science resource, already used by teachers in 10% of elementary schools. This past year we reached more than one million children in classrooms.Taub: What’s the business model of Mystery Science? Do you charge anything to use?Schacht: Most teachers learn about Mystery Science from a friend or colleague. They can sign up on the website for free and use everything we’ve created for a full school year. At the end of the school year their school or district purchases a membership for all of the teachers to continue using Mystery Science.Core to our mission is not only to create the best science learning experiences for children, but to make them the most affordable option on the market. Every other curriculum on the market is at least twice as expensive, many are five or six times as expensive as Mystery Science. It’s appalling both how expensive traditional textbooks and science curriculum are, and how rarely they’re actually used in the classroom.Taub: Does the name Mystery Science limit to what you can do in the future with other potential courses?Peltz: We’re intentionally staying focused on science. Science is the most important subject to be fixed in schools in order to accelerate human progress, so we’ll be focused on it for quite some time. We have quite a monumental task ahead of us. We’ve basically set ourselves the task of taking the sum total of human knowledge about how the world works and translating it into a form that is understandable to children. This is the science of explaining science—and it’s a field still in its infancy.Taub: Any great stories from teachers you can share?Schacht: One of the most surprising things to arise out of our success is the volume of fan mail we get. Doug now gets fan mail from students and teachers–actual letters sent to him through the postal service, expressing their thanks for what we’re doing. We get emails expressing gratitude literally every day now; it blows us away.Peltz: I knew we were creating something special when early on with Mystery Science, a teacher told us that after he finished his first Mystery Science lesson, his students applauded!One teacher recently messaged us to say that she gave her each of her students an end-of-year survey to find out what their favorite parts of the year was. Most of them cited doing Mystery Science each week. Mind you, these were lists that included things like recess.Another child got unexpectedly picked up early from school one day and was in tears that he was going to miss Mystery Science that week.I think one of my favorite stories was a parent who sent me a photo of her child ambling through the front yard on a foggy morning. She said her child came inside with a look of profound excitement on her face and said, “Mom! Hurry! This is our chance to feel what it’s like to walk through a cloud… fog is a cloud that’s on the ground!”Her daughter explained that she’d learned this from a Mystery Science lesson, and the mother was blown away. We had created this magical moment for her child; we changed how she looked at the world around her.That is what it’s all about for us.Taub: What are your plans for the rest of the year? Anything big coming out?Schacht: We have a significant expansion planned for every grade level, kindergarten through fifth grade. In addition, there are dozens of small but important ways that we’ll make it even easier for teachers to deliver incredible science experiences for their children. These range from offline support to making it easier to gather supplies for science investigations, to answering science questions that students ask their teachers.
