Barbara VanDenburgh from USA TODAY is browsing the shelves this week for some of the hottest new books on the market, and sharing her thoughts on it with you. 
Author Thomas Harris is back with a new novel about a meat merchant who kidnaps young women and harvests vital organs from them for sale to a wealthy international clientele. The help for Johnson puts Kardashian West in the spotlight for her work on prison reform, and "Life" promises a change behind the scenes. It's Harris's first book in 13 years, so you can rejoice at the prospect of creating a brand new psychopath for Hannibal Lecter. 
The Kirkus Reviews star gushed: 'I laughed out loud and consistently every cover of the story, from the first page to the last, and I still laugh. 
In McCarthy, doctors and researchers give readers an insight into the battle for a cure for antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as superbugs. Kirkus Reviews said: "The author's narrative style is powerful and empathetic in a compelling combination that leaves the reader informed and optimistic. I hope that this will encourage you to continue reading and writing safely until you collapse, but I hope that it will encourage those of you who continue reading and writing after the break. 
Sam Redd Sam Redd read and read all night, his mind full of facts, information and pictures from far-off places. One night he decided it was time for him to write his own book, and his imagination staggered with wonder and imagination. It was at home, he was reading and writing, but one night Sam decided to be at home for the first time in his life. 
He decided to write a book called Lonely Cheese, and working on it made him very hungry. It was good that he found so many crumbs to eat when he finished the illustrations. 
Proud, proud, he posted a picture of himself amid a pile of crumbs on the floor outside his London home. 
I went to the library's biography and autobiography department and put my first book on the shelf. I wrote the words and a picture of Sam on the cover and called it "the squeaky muse of my life." I drew the picture by posing in a small mirror and then sketching what I saw, and then sketching it again. 
Then I went to the biography and autobiography department of the library and then to the art department of the New York Public Library and the museum department. 
When the librarian opened the nursery in the morning, a piece of paper stuck to the door. I looked down at the pencils that were ready to go and saw my own face smiling at me. The little girl said: "Who is the author next to me in the mirror? 
Maybe you play an instrument, maybe you are a good artist, or you could explain how to make a picture, but how do you do that? They can explain so many possibilities and how they play their instruments, so what do they do? 
There is a picture of a little boy in a truck looking at a large book, eyes wide open and hands in his pockets, like a child. 
It was called The Mouse's Villa Secret and gave Sam goosebumps as he wrote the scary scene. Later, he put the lonely cheese on his desk and showed it to the children at story time. A full moon shone through the darkened library as Sneaky put his book on the shelf and then returned to his little hole in the wall. It was a book for me, "said the librarian, just as it was for Sam," but it gives me goosebumps when I write it.
